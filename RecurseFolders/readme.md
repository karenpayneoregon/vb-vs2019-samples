There are various code sample that have hard coded paths e.g. 

```csharp
Dim folderName = "C:\OED\Dotnetland\VS2019"
```

Before running the code samples look over the code for paths that don't exists on your computer and change them to folders that does exists.

In the ListViewForm, note the context menu for folder to search, there is a menu item *Documents* which will be converted to the current user's document folder and should work fine.
