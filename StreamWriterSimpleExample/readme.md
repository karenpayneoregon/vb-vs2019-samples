# About

A person asked in a forum question why data was not being written to a file. Their code created an empty text file.

This code is in reponse.

- They asked user for file name, this code hard codes the file name
- Data came from TextBox and ComboBox controls, here data is mocked where each property is Line x for easy validation
- ValueTuple are used to return success and an Exception object if there are runtime exceptions.
